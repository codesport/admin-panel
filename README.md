# Introduction and Project Overview

This tutorial was created for Facebook's 2020 Developer's challenge. It guides the learner in the creation of a harvest inventory app for a family-owned organic farm in North Carolina called *Arroyo Family Farms*.

The goal of this tutorial is to provide teh learner with a strong foundation in React. To this end, an discussion of basic and intermediate React development concepts is undertaken. Additional emphasis is placed on understanding ESCM Script version 6 (ES6) Javascript concepts required to develop proficiency as a React development developer.  

The learner is guided in creating stateful and interactive master-detail interface with Create, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality. This application may be readily adpated to create variety of applications (e.g., online store, an addressbok, and a todo-list).

This tutorial its resulting application were created by **Marcus "Arroyo" B.**. Arroyo is a Software Engineer In Residence (SEIR) within Code Sport Lab's Unit X Divsion.  

## Stage 1: Static Website
Our first step is to create a static, non-interactve website.  A common way to plan an application's design and development is by wireframing. You may use a pencil and paper, photoshop, or free online alternatives such as [Diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/index.html) to design your wireframe. 

However, we've opted to create a color-block diagram with Adobe Photoshop

**Figure 1: Stage 1 Layout of Appication**

Take Away: Each section of the wireframe will will respresent a React Component. Each Component can be firther subdivided into addional compont sif needed.

Each part of your app which renders data should be it's own compoenent.  To manage the compoeents we create a parent compoent called Conroller.

## Inspiration

The code used in this tutorial was inspired by a bevy of tutorials on Reactjs.org, expecially Thinking In React.



## Part 1 Beginner's Tutorial - Arroyo Family Farms' Inventory App

Part 1 serves as a beginner's tutorial and guides the learner in creating a static, stateless, and non-interactive application using React functional components. 

It assumes the learner has zero knowlege of React but is marginally proficient in core JavaScript concepts and is 



# About React
React is a Javascript library created by Facebook. It is focused on User Interface (UI) rendering (i.e., the view component of the Model View Controller \[MVC\] design pattern). It was open-sourced to the developer community on [May 29, 2013](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-react-js-on-a-timeline#2013theyearofthebiglaunch). React uses JavascScript ES6 and its apps are often coded in [JSX](https://www.google.com/search?what+is+JSX?). JSX allows the developer to combine HTML and JavaScript in the same line of code.  

## Conventions
In React, functional and class compoennts are declared using `PascalCase` (i.e., **must** have a capital letter).  Methods, functions within functional components,variables, an constants are declared using `camelCase` (i.e., first letter is lowercase).

Technically you can have all your  components in 1 file, however, for manageabilty, many developers prefer to have one component per file and use import statements when components need to be resused.

Refer to the Reacts documentation for more info on [conventions and use](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

## Functional Components
Functional components in React are composed of pure functions which are [first class objects (functions)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function) in JavaScript. As functions, a given set of inputs will always provide a predicatbel and guaranteed output. As first class objects, JavaScropt functions may be treated as variables.


## Class Components

Class compoenents are used to manage state in React applications.


React apps can get complicated very quickly. To minimze this tutorial will establish some rules that will help beginners to maximize their prouctivuty.  Traditionally, only class components could manage state.  There are now exceptions such as useState.  However, 

1. Create a single parent component that will control application state. This parent component will be a class compoente

    a. **Corrollary:** Children should be functional components. Their state will be lifted into and therefore manage by the parent component

2. If you find yourself repeating the same lines of code thtoughout a given parent or child component, combine that code into a method or function. Then call when needed

3. If you find yourself needing the same function in more than 2 component's, seperate that function into a seperate child 1. 1component and import it!


## Updates to JavaScript from ES6

React uses Javascript ES6. ES6 brings new features (e.g., the support of classes) to JavaScript that are common in traditional objected oriented languages such as C, Java, and Python. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will focus on the newly added `const` and `let` keywords as well as support for arrow funtions `() =>`. React uses a [Babel](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+babel) to allow ES6 to be backward compatible with older browsers.

*[`let`:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#Description)* is a variable declaration like var, but it is "hyper-localized" and is limited to a given code block in which it is assigned.  Conclusion: let is preferred to `var` due its granular, block-constrained localization which helps create more predictable code outcomes.

*[`const`:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/statements/const#Description)* is the constant declaration. It is also *hyper-localized* and is limited to a given code block in which it is assigned. Conclusion:  Functions can be assigned to constants and are often used in react for function declarations using arrow functions. In React, we typically don't write our constants in all-caps. Method names are written as first letter c

### Arrow Functions: `() =>`

A good rule of thumb for beginners is to **always use arrow functions** when defining methods within class functions. 

If you choose to use arrow functions to define functional components, declare them as constants via `const`.

Finally, if your event handler (e.g., onClick, onMouseOver, etc) requires arguments to be passed, you must use arrow functions to prevent the function from automattically excutng when the page is rendered

Like `let` and `const`, arrow functions are "hyper-localized". This means they are only "aware of" and execute in the scope where they were created. On the otherhand, traditional JavaScript functions bubble up to the window scope.

 Because of scope localization, arrow functions are of particular interest to react developers using class functions and referencing instances of `this`.  Arrow functions negate the need to "manually" bind functions to a given class within its constructor. [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) has a great tutorial on arrow functions. The below example shows a traditional function and its arrow function equivalent:

```javascript
const OUTER = 10;

//Traditional Function
function MyComponent(){
  let number = 3;
  number = number*OUTER; //expect 3*10 = 3-
  return number;
}

//Arrow Function
const MyOtherComponent = () => {
  let number = 3;
  number = number*OUTER; //expect 3*10 = 3-
  return number;  
}
```

If arrow fucntions are not used to create a method, the method must be "manually" binded the class in the constructor likeso: `this.myMethodName = this.myMethodName.bind(this);`


# Getting Started


## Setting-up a Local Development Enviorment for React

### VSCode Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is our editor of choice. The below suggestions will optimize it for React development

1. Install [Babel Javascript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel).  Created by Michael McDermont, it provides VSCode syntax highlighting for JavaScript ES6, React JSX, Flow, and GraphQL.

2. Install Sergii Naumov's [Oceanic Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.theme-oceanicnext). It supports a more granular level of syntax highlighting for nested properties.

### React Environment Setup

1. Install the LTS of version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

2. Using your terminal (i.e., CLI), navigate to the project folder where you will save the project.  

3. Within your terminal type `npx create-react-app  admin-panel`  
   * NB: `admin-panel` is the name of the application in this tutorial.
   * Refer to the [official react tutorials](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to learn more about the `npx` and `create-react-app` directves  

  * ESLint is correctly letting you know that you are writing weak code
4. Finally, type `npm start` to run the default react application




## The Directory Structure

*node_modules/:* standard node folder to store dependencies, packages (e.g., Babel) and libraries (e.g., React). 

*public/:* folder with global read privaleges (i.e., public , web accesible).  Only store public content here suhc as images and html files

*public/index.html:* Used by index.js to render the react app.  The app gets rendered to an arbitrary id's (default is 'root') DOM in this file  via this code `<div id="root"></div>`.

*index.css:* Global stylesheet. 
 
*index.js:*  Application entry point.  Renders App.js to an arbitrary id (default is id 'root') in public/index.html. Update to import App from './components/App' . 
 Here is the code in index.js that renders the App component within the `<div id=root>` of index.html: 
```JSX
   ReactDOM.render(
    <App />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
 ``` 

*App.js:* A container component and parent for react react applications.     Recreate and store in src/components. 
 

Create a folder

## Thinking In React

A React application is composed of *modular peices of code* which compute and/or display a portion of application's UI. These modular pieces are called are encapsulated *components*.  Components should follow the single-use principle of SOLID Obect Oriented (OO) design.   If you are not familiar with SOLID principles, [Hash Bang Code](https://www.hashbangcode.com/article/solid-principles-php) has a excellent tutorial.

Within react there are two kinds of components: functional and class. This means that React applications may be either created using OO Classes or pure functions

### Wire Frame the App's Component Diagram

You may use a piece of paper or Diagrams

> how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if
> you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility
> principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it
> should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

> Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.
> your UI (and therefore your component structure) should map

### Arrange Components into a hierarchy



### Build Static Version of Site 

This principle also entails rendering the UI with static data. Facebooks's reasoning for this approach is bullet proof.  To summarize:

> ...building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity 
> requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.
> - [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react)

> In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to code your component model top-down [parent to child],
> and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build
> - [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react)



### Identify which components need to be state and convert them to Class Components

Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs. [Then] compute everything else you need on-demand. 

or example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.

           />
          {/*<Detail selectedDetail={this.state.selectedDetail} /> this sends all elements of selected Detail array*/}


          <Detail selectedDetail={this.state.Detail.filter((detail) => detail.id === this.state.selectedDetail)[0]} /> 

                 
      </div>
